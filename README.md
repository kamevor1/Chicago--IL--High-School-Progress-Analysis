Introduction:

The purpose of this project is to study the high school progress of the Chicago public schools. We wanted to analyze how each school is doing compared to others. After analyzing our data, we noticed that most students in the Chicago public high schools graduate in 5 years instead of the traditional 4-year period. Our data came short of explaining why such thing is happening. A background study however reveals lack of parental involvement in the student life and socio economic class deeply affect the achievement of the student. Overall, schools that perform well are mostly located in the affluent areas of the city.

Findings:

Schools in the south side of the city are among the worst performers. The schools with the lowest graduation rates also have the highest dropout rates and lowest college enrollment rates. 
College persistence rate is pretty low as well. We noticed only about half of the students who enrolled in college returned the second year. This rate might be due to students possibly dropping out or transferring out of the state.

Conclusion:

Education is the biggest drive of economic prosperity. The numbers reflected in these data show that Chicago needs to solve its education problems so that its schools can perform better. The high dropout rate of high school students and low college retention can be explained by two assumptions. Either the students are not well prepared out of graduating high school to perform well at the college level or the students could not pursue college education due to personal reasons such as financial or lack of interest. 
To find out more about those issues, schools need to get more involved in students life and see how they are doing outside of school. This can be done by establishing a solid communication channel with the parents and implementing programs and provide resources that will help students from low income families apply themselves at school.
